nuancier-lite
=============

Nuancier-lite is a light weight voting application for the supplementary
wallpapers of Fedora.


For each release of Fedora a number of supplementary wallpapers are provided.
These wallpapers are submitted by contributors to the community who choose among
them those that will be included in the release.

The current election application does not support voting on images.
Nuancier-lite aims at providing a simple application for voting on these images.

Nuancier-lite is meant as a temporary solution before elections or nuancier
takes over, but in the meanwhile it does provide a nicer way to vote for the
supplementary wallpapers.
